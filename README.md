## Provenience

The Yorba Foundation inherited the initial gexiv2 code from Mike Gemuende
(his initial repository was available at gitorious but is now defunct. It was archived at [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20121215131750/http://gitorious.org/gexiv2)).  

Yorba transferred the copyright to the Software Freedom Conservancy in
2016. It has been maintained by people from the GNOME community since.
