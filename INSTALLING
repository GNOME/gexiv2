    gexiv2 Installation
    -------------------

    To build and install gexiv2, type the following commands:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

    When building from git, you need to run ./autgen.sh to generate the
    configure script.

    * By default, gexiv2 will install under /usr/local.  The configure script
      can customize the prefix directory.  Run ./configure --help for
      instructions and other installation options.
  
    * You may need to execute "make install" as root (i.e. sudo make install)
      if installing to system directories.
